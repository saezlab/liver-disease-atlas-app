# Welcome to the Liver disease atlas

<!-- badges: start -->

The prevalence of chronic liver diseases (CLD) has increased during the
last decades. Mouse models are frequently used to study the
pathophysiology of liver diseases, identify therapeutic targets, and
test drug candidates.

To allow a better assessment of translational relevance from mouse
models to human CLD we analyzed genome-wide transcriptome data from
seven mouse models (one with chronic and six with acute liver damage)
comprising 227 mice and five studies of human CLD with a total of 372
patients. See tables below for a summary of the analyzed dataset.

See the corresponding publication for more details: [*Transcriptomic
cross-species analysis of chronic liver disease reveals a consistent
regulation pattern between humans and mice*]()

## About

This application informs for any gene of interest on:

-   mean expression changes in the chronic and acute mouse models and in
    patients of different liver disease etiologies. Users may choose to
    show the log-fold changes or the t-statistic both derived from a
    differential gene expression analysis.

-   the categorization into genes that are altered exclusively during
    acute or chronic damage or commonly deregulated in both acute and
    chronic mouse models. See the *chronicity* box. This classification
    is not available for any gene. For a complete list please visit the
    `data` tab.

-   the associated cell type in which we found the gene also
    significantly deregulated between cirrhotic and healthy patients.
    This information was inferred from from single-cell RNA-seq data.

-   if the gene is consistently altered in mice and humans. If this is
    true, the rank is displayed. See the *consistency* box. The better
    the displayed rank (from low to high) the stronger the gene is
    consistently altered in human and mice. Please visit the `data` tab
    to see the full list of genes.
