### Celltype

***

Liver cell type in which we found the gene significantly deregulated between cirrhotic and healthy patients. This information was inferred from a publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data by [Ramachandran et al. Nature, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1631-3?proof=t).
